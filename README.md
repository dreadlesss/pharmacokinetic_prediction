| SMILES |             smiles of the compound                  |
| fu     |            fraction unbound drugs in plasma         |
| MRT    |      mean residence time of a drug in human blood   |
| t1/2   |            the half-life of a drug                  |
| VD     |              volume of distribution                 |
| CL     |                   clearance                         |

## Feature extraction
**<function extract_features()>**

Molecules are represented by morgan fingerprint(radius=2, length=2048) and 200 descriptors(generated by rdkit)

## Splits of training and testing data
**<function stratified_split()>**

The whole data set are divided into training and testing data set with the proportion ~7:3 using stratified sampling strategy.

## Models
**<Class auto_gbdt()>**

GBDT is used to fit the training data set.
The parameters are optimized automatically by GridsearchCV.
RMSD as a criteria to evaluate the model performance on the test set.
